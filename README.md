Mikes Angel's - A general game player written by Vik Pattabi, David Gonzalez, and Sona Allahverdiyeva based upon a codebase written by the course staff for Stanford's CS227B.

Notes for the team:
-Open a terminal and cd into the local folder where you want the project to be
-In order to access the code, make sure you have connected your local directory to this github by typing git remote add github https://github.com/vikpattabi/Mikes_Angels
-When you want to modify the code, type git pull
-When you have finished and want to push the code back up to the repository, type git commit -m "Your message here" to let us know what you changed. Then type git push to upload the code. 

If we have any problems with merging files, etc., let me know and I'll try and figure it out. For now, let's avoid working on the code simultaneously.
